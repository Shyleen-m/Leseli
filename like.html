    <h1>Hey Leseli!</h1>
    <p class="heart">‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
    <p>I‚Äôve been thinking about this for a while and I just have to say I really like you . Getting to know you has been amazing,the conversations that we have ,the more I realize how much I enjoy talking to you. You‚Äôre beautiful and funny and I love that you‚Äôre a lady after Gods heart. I wanted to wait until you came to Harare but I just don‚Äôt want to admire you from a distance ,I want to be there for you ,to make you smile ,to be your prayer partner and everything in between . With all that‚Äôs been said</p>
